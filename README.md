# Smartphone-Based-Distress-Detection

This was a research project our aim was to -
Detect if a person was in distress by real time acoustic monitoring of the person's environment using his android phone. 
If there was a scream ,more specifically scream that sounds like someone is in pain then we generated an update on server creating a log of user's
location and audio clip.

My Contribution - 
I handled the server side for the application.
Developed my own algorithm for reducing power consumption of our app using cooperative analysis.
 Added various new features like heatmaps for analysing collected data.We are currently doing research to develop an algorithm that 
dynamically chooses best microphone in an environment.
